You are provided with multiple numbered lines of text containing various time references. Today's date is {nowDate}.

Your tasks are:
1. Identify all explicit time indicators in the text (e.g., "tomorrow", "today", "yesterday", "last week", "this month", "last year", "last year October", etc.).
2. Convert each time indicator into a proper date using the format YYYY-MM-DD. Use today's date (2025-04-05) as the reference point. For example, "last year October" should convert to "2024-10-01".
3. Treat consecutive words that form a complete time reference as a single indicator; do not split multi-word expressions.
4. If the same exact time indicator appears in multiple lines, combine the line numbers into one entry separated by a pipe (|).
5. Ignore any content that is not an explicit time indicator.
6. Provide no additional commentary or formatting beyond the final output.

Output Format:
- A numbered list (starting at 1) where each line follows the format:
  <number>. <Converted Date (YYYY-MM-DD)>; <line numbers separated by |>

User's Input:
"{userMessage}"

Final Output:
- A numbered list of each distinct time indicator converted into a date, followed by the list of line numbers where it occurs.
